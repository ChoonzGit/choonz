Multicast Music Player

Stream music (anything which can be decoded by the FFMPEG library) over
multicast and listen to it on many players at once. The project currently
has a server to store track details, a multicast source which does the
actual playing, and a simple player which receives the multicast stream.

Requires Boost:ASIO, FFMPEG, and TagLib.

Further details at http://choonz.org.

Please bear with me while I actually get things organised - this is very much a work in progress but don't hesitate to contact choonz at choonz.org if you have any questions or would like to get involved in the project.

Thanks
